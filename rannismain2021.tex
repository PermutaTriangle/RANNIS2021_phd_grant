\section{Specific aims of the project, research questions/hypotheses, feasibility, originality and impact}
\spacing{1.5}

\emph{Combinatorial exploration} is an experimental approach that
rigorously derives structural results about mathematical objects.
When a human has discovered the structure of an object there
are several tools, often automatic, which allow various properties of the object
to be computed. However, the steps from the problem statement and the original
object to the structure is often ad-hoc.
A framework is being developed at Reykjavik University to automate and formalize
these steps.
A beta version of the framework, called
\motheralg{} (\explofmothername) exists. It has mainly been applied in
the field of permutation patterns and is called in that context the
\tilealg algorithm. This algorithm has been able
to discover new theorems and rediscover several results
spanning dozens of papers in the research literature.

We propose to integrate techniques from machine learning to enhance the beta,
as well as improving the algorithm to find more general descriptions
of mathematical objects.
The outcome of this proposal will be
publications in journals and presentations at international
conferences. The implementation of
these theoretical algorithms will be made available free and open source and
will be accompanied by a comprehensive manual.
\subsection*{The \motheralg{} framework}

\motheralg{} performs combinatorial
exploration in two main stages. First is the expansion stage, where \emph{strategies} are
applied to the objects of interest, resulting in a universe of rules
relating the objects. The second stage is to check if there exists
a \emph{specification} for the original object of interest
within this set of rules. The term \emph{specification} has a technical meaning,
but we can think of it as a system of equations describing the structure of an
object. If a specification exists in the universe \motheralg{} is guaranteed to
find it.
If no specifications are found, \motheralg{} re-enters the expansion stage,
enlarging the universe, until searching again, \emph{etc}.

We will show below how \motheralg{} has been applied to the field of permutation
patterns, but ask the reader to remember that the framework can be applied in
other fields.
As is to be expected with a beta version there is room for improvement. In
particular, even though the
framework is guaranteed to find a specification in the universe if
one exists, there are cases where the universe contains enough information to
describe the original object, without any specification existing for it.

There is no existing theory for this phenomenon but we say
that the universe contains a \emph{combinatorial system} for the object.
Even if some combinatorial systems have been found by hand~\cite{BeanPhd},
there is currently no way to find them automatically.
The proposer will develop heuristics and algorithms to find combinatorial systems.

\subsection*{The \tilealg{} algorithm}
A \emph{permutation} is a reordering of the integers $1, 2, \dotsc, n$
for some $n$. Although
these are simple objects, they have deep connections to other fields. Famous
examples include Schubert varieties~\cite{MR1051089}, posets~\cite{MR2652101},
water waves~\cite{MR2813307}, genome rearrangements~\cite{MR2518996}, planar maps~\cite{CKS09}
meanders~\cite{fukuda:042202}, and sorting operators~\cite{MR0445948}.
A permutation $\pi$ \emph{contains} the permutation $p$ if certain technical
conditions are satisfied. We only give an example here: The permutation $\pi = 526413$
contains $p = 132$,  in the subsequences $264$, $263$ and $243$; see
Figure~\ref{fig:perm526413} where we have additionally circled the occurrences of $p$.

\caption{The permutation $526413$ and three occurrences of the $132$}%
\label{fig:perm526413}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The same permutation \emph{avoids} $123$, as it has no
increasing subsequence of length three.  In this context we refer to $p$ as a
 \emph{pattern}. The main object of study in this field is
the (usually infinite) set of permutations that avoid a given pattern, denoted $\Av(p)$,
and called a \emph{permutation class}.

Domain-specific knowledge from the field of permutation
patterns was added to \motheralg{} to create the
\tilealg{} algorithm.
When \tilealg{} succeeds it produces a specification in the form of a tree,
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:123_1432}, for the permutations avoiding the patterns $123$
and $1432$, first enumerated by West~\cite{West:1996cy}.

\end{figure}
So far, the \tilealg{} algorithm has proved to be a excellent
tool,  providing structural and enumerative results that together subsume over
a dozen of existing research papers.

The proposer will undertake the creation
of a generalization of the \tilealg{} algorithm that describes the structure of permutation
classes in a finer way by accounting for permutation statistics.
The study of permutation statistics is an active area of research in
combinatorics~\cite{bukata2019statisitics, dokos2012statistics,
babson2000vincular,branden2011meshpattern}.
and similar research is being done more widely on
statistics of other combinatorial objects~\cite{findstat, MR4011551, MR4109929}.
One important example of a
permutation statistic is the inversion number. An \emph{inversion} is a pair of
entries in a permutation such that the leftmost entry of the pair has value
greater than the rightmost entry on the pair. The \emph{inversion number} of a
permutation is the number of pairs of entries it has that form an inversion;
as such, the
inversion number is a function from the set of all permutations to $\mathbb{N}$.
For example, the inversions of the permutation $526413$
(see Figure~\ref{fig:perm526413}) are $52, 54,51,53,21,64,61,63,41$ and $43$.
Hence, the inversion count of $526413$ is 9.
More generally, a \emph{permutation statistic} is any function from the set of
all permutations to $\mathbb{N}$.


\subsection*{Machine learning and heuristics}
The \motheralg{} beta is a naive breadth-first search algorithm. The
general objectives which the algorithm is trying to accomplish have clear
analogies with other tree-search paradigms. For instance
\emph{iterative deepening}~\cite{KORF198597,russell2002artificial},
i.e., pursuing a search deeper at promising nodes
before returning to a generally breadth-first approach. Since there is no
existing expert knowledge in the field to determine how to evaluate what
constitutes a ``promising'' node this approach would need to be coupled with
machine learning of such evaluation functions based on the beta's
experience over a wide variety of training examples, both successful and
unsuccessful.

\subsection*{Feasibility, originality, and impact}
Given a
specification for a mathematical object there are methods, often automatic, for
understanding the object structurally and enumeratively.
To find a
specification for an object, mathematicians have often
used ad-hoc techniques and the theory has not been developed as much.
\motheralg{} and the theory of combinatorial exploration will bridge this gap
and automate the process of going from an object to a
specification. Rather than rediscovering similar methods and repeating the same
ideas, \motheralg{} will push mathematical developments in new directions.

The beta version has been very successful and found
specifications for classes that had entire papers devoted to them, including but
not limited to~\cite{inflationsofgridclasses, smoothclasses, le-wilfclasses,
dbis, jaysgridclasses}.
Despite these successes, numerous interesting cases still remain, in particular,
$\Av(1324)$, the biggest open problem in the field, against which every new
proof method is tested.
If we are successful in finding a structure
and generating function for unenumerated classes, in particular
$\Av(1324)$, it would be considered a major breakthrough. Even tighter bounds
on the enumeration of this set are worthy of publication.

\section{Present state of knowledge in the field}
\spacing{1.5}
There exist specialized algorithms for enumerating permutation classes, such as
enumeration schemes of \mbox{Zeilberger}~\cite{MR1682929} with a generalization
that accounts for statistics of \mbox{Baxter}~\cite{baxter2014scheme_statistics};
regular insertion encoding of \mbox{Albert}, \mbox{Linton}, and \mbox{Ru\v{s}kuc}~\cite{MR2176523};
substitution decomposition of classes with finitely many simple permutations
of \mbox{Bassino} et al.~\cite{subdecompimplement}; and
guessing a disjoint union of grid classes of Bean, Gudmundsson, and Ulfarsson~\cite{algstruct, structpaper}.
These algorithms are deterministic and either succeed or fail on their inputs.
The \motheralg{} framework is different in that it generates a universe of true
statements about the object under investigation, and from this universe one can
often extract enough information to reveal the structure of the object. What we
are proposing in this application is strengthening the framework in such a way that
it can reveal the structure of the object with a smaller universe, therefore making
it applicable to more problems.

\section{Research plan (time and work plan, methodology, milestones, present status of project, etc.) and deliverables. Refer to more detailed description of milestones and deliverables in part  3 in the IRF electronic application system. Explain if consents and/or permits are needed}
\spacing{1.5}

\noindent \textbf{Time and work plan.}
The work packets are detailed under milestones below, as well as when they will
be attempted.

\noindent\textbf{Methodology.}
Some methods used will be traditional, coming from combinatorics, algorithms and
computer science. We will also use newer tools, such as generalized grid classes
and mesh patterns. We will also introduce new strategies, and
apply methods from computer science, such as probabilistic search and machine
learning.

\noindent \textbf{Milestones.}
\begin{packed_enum}

\item[WP1] Develop algorithm to find combinatorial systems automatically.
    (Jan-Dec '\yearofappls)
\item[WP2] Implement iterative deepening search in the framework. (Jan-Jun '\yearofapplsp)
\item[WP3] Extend the \tilealg{} algorithm to find specifications and
    combinatorial systems that describe permutation statistics in classes.
    (Jul-Dec '\yearofapplsp)

\end{packed_enum}

\noindent\textbf{Present status of the project.} As we noted in the subsection on
feasibility, originality, and impact of our work, our beta has been successful
with several cases. As can be expected from a beta, there are many
obvious avenues for improvements, such as
searching in a more clever manner, looking for combinatorial systems and
finding specifications that describe statistics.

\noindent\textbf{Deliverables.}
Results obtained will be turned into papers and talks at conferences, as is
customary with mathematical research.  We hope that these results will lead to
more work by others in the area. The developed code base will be made publicly
available for others to use and extend.
